\chapter{Advanced Stream Programming}
\label{ch:advanced-streams}

This chapter explores advanced stream programming patterns including stream networks, back-pressure, and termination handling.

\section{Stream Networks}

[To be developed: connecting multiple stream processors]

\section{Producer-Consumer Patterns}

[To be developed: buffering, synchronization]

\section{Back-Pressure}

[To be developed: flow control in stream networks]

\section{Termination and End-of-Stream}

[To be developed: proper termination protocols]

\section{Error Handling in Streams}

[To be developed: propagating errors through stream networks]

\section{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\star$] Implement a bounded buffer between producer and consumer.
\item[$\star\star$] Design a load-balancing stream splitter.
\item[$\star\star\star$] Implement a stream-based publish-subscribe system.
\end{enumerate}
