\chapter{Implementation-Ready GLP}
\label{app:irglp}

This appendix presents a deterministic, implementation-ready specification for \GLP, suitable for workstation and smartphone implementations.

\section{Overview}

The nondeterministic transition system of Chapter~\ref{ch:glp-core} is a \emph{specification}. For implementation, we need deterministic choices for:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Goal selection: which unit goal to reduce next
\item Message delivery: when to apply pending assignments
\item Suspension handling: how to track and reactivate suspended goals
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goal Scheduling}

Goals are maintained in a ready queue. Selection is round-robin with priority for activated goals.

\section{Suspension and Activation}

When a goal suspends on reader $X?$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The goal is moved to a wait set indexed by $X?$
\item When $X?$ receives a value, all goals in its wait set are activated
\item Activated goals are added to the front of the ready queue
\end{enumerate}

\section{Message Delivery}

Messages are delivered when:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A goal requiring the message becomes active
\item The message is in the pending set
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deterministic Transition System}

[Formal specification to be developed]

\section{Smartphone Implementation}

For smartphone deployment, additional considerations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Network communication via message passing
\item Dynamic shared-variable tables
\item Pull-based rather than push-based communication
\end{enumerate}
